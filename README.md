##How do I use it?
Anytime you need a picture, just embed the link:
```
http://signs.one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=TEXT
```


If you want to specify the size, use the r parameter:
```
http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=TEXT&r=500
```


You can also chose from the colours orange, green, blue or pink using the c parameter:
```
http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=TEXT&r=500&c=blue
```
