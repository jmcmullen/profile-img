##How do I use it?
Anytime you need a picture, just embed the link:

`http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=FIRSTNAME%20LASTNAME`


If you want to specify the size, use the r parameter:

`http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=FIRSTNAME%20LASTNAME&r=500`


You can also chose from the colours orange, green, blue or pink using the c parameter:

`http://one-education.org/profile-img/index.php?n=FIRSTNAME%20LASTNAME&r=500&c=blue`
